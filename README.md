# Notes on installing Arch Linux

These are my (post-)install notes for various platforms on which I install Arch Linux. I keep these because I'm inclined to forget the details. And while all the details are available elsewhere, just searching for them (again!) is time-consuming.

I welcome pull requests.

Mike.
